A simple Object-Oriented Python project that simulates a hotel booking system with credit card validation.

🛏️ Check room availability and make reservations

👤 Store customer details

💳 Validate credit card numbers before confirming a booking

🧩 Built with clean OOP design (Hotel, ReservationTicketHotel, CreditCard, SecureCreditCard)

This project shows my ability to use Python OOP principles and implement real-world workflows like booking and payment verification.
